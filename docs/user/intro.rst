Introduction
============

StackAPI was written to scratch an itch and in the process make my life
a bit easier than messing with ``curl`` or ``urllib`` while doing so.

I am releasing it to the world in hopes that it helps someone else while
they work with Stack Exchange's API. In return, I hope you will consider
adding features you need and releasing them back to me so we can help
others.

-----------

A large number of open source projects you find today are `GPL Licensed`_.
While the GPL has its time and place, it should most certainly not be your
go-to license for your next open source project.

A project that is released as GPL cannot be used in any commercial product
without the product itself also being offered as open source.

The MIT, BSD, ISC, and Apache2 licenses are great alternatives to the GPL
that allow your open-source software to be used freely in proprietary,
closed-source software.

Requests is released under terms of the `MIT License`_.
